### Description:
In this new application of machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost and RFE) on gene expression data, the gene "TPK1" emerged as the second most predictive gene for classifying endometriosis, a potentially debilitating disease that affects ~10% of all women on earth and currently has no cure nor effective, long-term treatment options. This data science work positioned the gene TPK1 as a new biomarker, which the existing medical literature has yet to recognize. Interestingly, healthy samples displayed a bimodal TPK1 expression profile, whereas endometriosis samples exhibited a more continuous and elevated pattern, suggesting a potentially “locked-in” metabolic state driven by chronic inflammation. These findings open a fresh avenue for investigating TPK1’s mechanistic role in endometriosis pathophysiology and underscore the power of non-linear, ensemble-based models in uncovering hidden diagnostic biomarkers for endometriosis.
